  Test code for the clock class.

  This is a demo file that shows usage of the clock class in three
  scenarios: one in which real time is tracked, one in which clock
  time is twice as fast as real time, and one in which clock time is
  half as fast as real time. 

  The last test, HalfTime, is heavily commented to provide some
  guidance on how to work with time.
